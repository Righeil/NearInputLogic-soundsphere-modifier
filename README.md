# What is it?
This is a gameplay modifier that changes the standard hit counting logic to similar logic from stepmania/etterna.
- In soundsphere/osu/quaver only counts the late notes available in the entire timing window.
- In stepmania/etterna, only the closest note to the current time is counted. (if the person who explained this logic to me was right)

# Todo:
- Confirm that this logic completely repeats this logic from stepmania
- Fix all bugs
